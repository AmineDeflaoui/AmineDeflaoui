- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmineDeflaoui ,
- 👀 I am a web developer❤. I try playing HTML, CSS and JavaScript (React) Node.js (NPM) ,Express, SQL (Postgres) almost every day;
      I am curious, I like to challenge me to learn new things and develop in different directions.
      I try my best to keep up with the latest technological developments so that I can use tools that are very suitable for the job at hand to meet the challenges.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Node.js and Express.
