- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmineDeflaoui ,
- 👀 I am a Moroccan Full Stack Web Developer ❤ that self-taught myself, I have expertise in both front-end and back-end development,
and I've always been a curious person, therefore I'd want to work with others and complete some practical projects to advance my skills.

- 🌱 I enjoy having my skills and knowledge stretched in order to learn new things,
I make an effort to stay current with new development tools and technologies in order to handle the difficulties.
